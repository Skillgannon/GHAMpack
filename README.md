# GHAMpack

Software package for solving 1D nonlinear, variable coefficient boundary value problems (BVPs) using Matlab. This code uses a new variant of the Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) in order to numerically solve these BVPs to machine precision. This code uses sparse basis functions, and has been shown to converge spectrally, and scale with O(n), where n is the grid resolution.
